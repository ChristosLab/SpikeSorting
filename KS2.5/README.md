# SpikeSorting
Lab scripts for spike sorting and visualization
My inital setup will consist of three top level directories:  
Windows versions- this will contain legacy files as well as currently work versions tested on our windows System useful iftthe cluster is
down and analysis is still needed.   
Incluster - These are the cluster versions of the various scripts as windows versions as a general rule there will be fewer things in here 
as compared to Windows version.   
Cluster Ready- These are basically files under development they have not been tested in the Cluster yet but will have a working windows
version in a perfect world this directory is empty.
